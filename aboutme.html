  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>The thing that I am working on in my personal life is being the CEO of a business. The thing that are leading me to it was the two classes of entrepreneurship and getting teach the importance of a business. They also teched me how to keep a business in order.         
The way I'm working toward my goal is getting inspired by other successful business owners. I also remember the two classes i took in middle school and how to keep a business together.
The values I consider for my successful is the value of knowing how to keep a business in order and keep it running and not let it go out of business. I would make my business of what people like more so more people go buy from my business.
The short term goal that I hope to accomplish in the future is passing high school and getting into a good marketing college and that way I could learn more about a business. 
The character traits and achievements i want to be known for is having a amazing business and having a lot of customers that will comeback and also have good reviews on the business that way more and more people come in.</p>
